### Makefile
The `Makefile` is used to compile and build the `io_uring` kernel module, which enables asynchronous I/O operations in Linux. It includes various object files for different functionalities, such as file handling, networking, polling, timeouts, and more. The build process adapts based on configuration options, enabling features like Zero-Copy Receive (ZC Rx), futex, and epoll. It also supports optional profiling for code coverage. Essentially, the `Makefile` configures and compiles the kernel module with the appropriate features based on the system's configuration.

## Source
### sqpoll.c
The `sqpoll.c` file handles a special helper thread in the Linux kernel that speeds up `io_uring` by watching for I/O work and submitting it without needing the app to ask each time. This thread runs in the background, can pause when idle, and wakes up when there’s work to do, helping make I/O faster and more efficient.

### statx.c
The `statx.c` file provides functionality for handling `statx` system calls in `io_uring`, which is a faster way to retrieve file status information. It sets up the request, retrieves the file information, and performs the `statx` operation in the background. The file also manages memory and cleans up after the operation is done, ensuring efficient file status checks without blocking the application.

### sync.c
The `sync.c` file handles operations like syncing a file's data, flushing its metadata, and allocating space in it using `io_uring`. These actions are set up with details like file positions and flags, and are performed in the background. When done, the system saves the results and notifies the file system about any changes made.

### tctx.c
The `tctx.c` file handles the management of task-specific contexts for `io_uring`, which is a high-performance I/O interface in Linux. It manages task data structures, offloads work to I/O queues, and keeps track of files registered to the task. This includes setting up task contexts for I/O operations, adding or removing nodes in task queues, and managing file descriptors linked to the task. The file also ensures proper cleanup when the task ends and handles errors related to registering or unregistering resources.

### timeout.c
The `timeout.c` file manages timeouts in the Linux kernel's `io_uring` system, which handles asynchronous input/output operations. It ensures tasks either complete within a set time or get canceled if they take too long. The code allows for repeated timeouts, updating or canceling them, and linking tasks together. Essentially, it's designed to handle tasks that must finish on time, ensuring smooth operation by managing when and how tasks time out or are retried.

### truncate.c
The `truncate.c` deals with truncating (cutting down the size of) files asynchronously using `io_uring`, a Linux kernel system for efficient input/output operations. It defines two main parts: the preparation (`io_ftruncate_prep`) and the execution (`io_ftruncate`) of file truncation. The preparation step ensures that the necessary parameters for truncating the file (like the target file size) are correctly set up. The execution step actually performs the truncation by calling `do_ftruncate` and records the result. This approach allows truncation to happen without blocking other tasks, supporting non-blocking, efficient file operations in user space.

### uring_cmd.c
The `uring_cmd.c` is part of a system called `io_uring`, which improves how computers handle I/O (input/output) tasks like reading/writing files or managing network connections. It allows tasks to run in the background without blocking other work, making the system more efficient. The code specifically handles commands for setting and getting network options, cleaning up after tasks, and canceling requests when needed, ensuring the system can quickly process multiple operations at once.

### waitid.c
The `waitid.c` file handles asynchronous notifications for the `waitid` system call, allowing processes to wait for events (like child process termination) without blocking. It manages tasks, triggers callbacks when events occur, and cleans up after completion or cancellation of requests. It also ensures compatibility with older systems.

### xattr.c
The `xattr.c` file contains functions for handling extended attributes (xattrs) in the `io_uring` framework. It defines structures and functions for reading and writing xattrs associated with files, using asynchronous I/O operations. The functions handle tasks like preparing for xattr retrieval or modification, managing cleanup, and interacting with the kernel’s internal xattr APIs for both file descriptors and file paths. It also includes error handling and ensures that resources are freed after completing the operations. The code supports both fetching and setting xattrs in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner.

### zcrx.c
The `zcrx.c` file implements the Zero-Copy Receive (ZC Rx) feature, allowing network data to be directly received into user-space memory, bypassing the kernel for improved performance. It requires special network hardware support, like header/data splitting and flow steering, and works by registering a memory area and refill ring with the kernel, enabling faster data transfer while still handling packet headers in the kernel.

## Headers

### sqpoll.h
The `sqpoll.h` file handles the management of a thread that helps process I/O requests in the `io_uring` system. It defines how the system organizes and controls the thread that submits tasks, making sure it operates efficiently by managing its state, CPU usage, and synchronization.

### statx.h
The `statx.h` header defines functions related to retrieving file status information in the `io_uring` system. It includes preparations for making a request to gather file status, the actual function to execute the request, and a cleanup function to manage resources after the operation is completed.

### sync.h
The `sync.h` header defines functions for managing file synchronization and allocation in the `io_uring` system. It includes preparations and functions for syncing file ranges, syncing file data (fsync), and allocating space in a file. These operations help manage how file data is written or synchronized between the kernel and storage devices asynchronously.

### tctx.h
The `tctx.h` header handles the management of task contexts in `io_uring`. It defines structures and functions for associating tasks with specific `io_uring` ring contexts, adding or removing these associations, and cleaning up task contexts. It also includes functions for registering and unregistering the ring file descriptor and managing cancellation operations related to `io_uring` tasks. This enables efficient tracking and management of tasks that use asynchronous I/O.

### timeout.h
The `timeout.h` header deals with managing timeouts in `io_uring`. It defines structures and functions for setting, disarming, and canceling timeouts related to asynchronous I/O operations. The `io_timeout_data` structure stores information about each timeout, including the associated request and the timer settings. The header provides functions for handling linked timeouts, flushing timeouts, and preparing timeout-related requests, allowing efficient management of timeout behavior in the `io_uring` framework.

### truncate.h
The `truncate.h` header defines functions for handling file truncation operations in `io_uring`. It includes functions to prepare and execute truncation requests, allowing files to be resized asynchronously. These functions help manage file truncation efficiently as part of the asynchronous I/O framework in Linux.

### uring_cmd.h
The `uring_cmd.h` header defines structures and functions for managing asynchronous commands within `io_uring`. It includes the `io_async_cmd` structure, which holds command data, vectors, and submission queue entries for executing commands asynchronously. The functions handle command preparation, execution, cancellation, and cleanup. They also include utilities for importing fixed vectors and managing memory for command entries, ensuring efficient handling of I/O requests in the `io_uring` framework.

### waitid.h
The `waitid.h` header provides structures and functions for handling asynchronous `waitid` operations within the `io_uring` framework.

The functions allow for preparing, executing, canceling, and removing `waitid` requests asynchronously, facilitating non-blocking process status checks and task management in `io_uring`.

### xattr.h
The `xattr.h` file contains functions that let programs work with extra metadata (called extended attributes or xattrs) on files in a non-blocking way. It provides functions to add, retrieve, or remove this extra information from files, both in general and for specific files identified by file descriptors. These operations are handled asynchronously, meaning the program can keep doing other tasks while waiting for the file operations to complete. The file also includes cleanup functions to manage resources used during these operations.

### zcrx.h
The `zcrx.h` header defines structures and functions related to Zero-Copy Receive (ZC Rx) in `io_uring`, which allows network packet data to be received directly into userspace memory without intermediate copies. It includes definitions for areas that manage received data, interfaces for configuring network device queues for zero-copy, and mechanisms for managing the lifecycle of these areas. Conditional compilation ensures that these functions are only included if ZC Rx is supported. The header also provides functions to register, unregister, and receive data through zero-copy operations.
